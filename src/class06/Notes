Whenever we want to use switchTo an iFrame
you can do that using 3 methods
1. By index()
2. By name, id
3. By finding the WebElement or using locator

indexing starts with 0 in iframe

----------------------------------------------------Waits------------------------------------------------------------

Implicit Wait:
     it is going to wait for the WebElement to be found until the timeout
Syntax:
     driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
          OR
     driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

Time limits for implicit wait is 20000 MilliSeconds and not more but if you want to increase the time limits then
it's up to you. but 20000 MilliSeconds is advisable

Approach:
    to declare them only once in the starting of your code--> also called global waits cause it will apply to all your codes.


Explicit Wait:
     also known as conditional wait

     Conditions:

    1. wait for the webElement to be visible
    2. wait for the webElement to be clickable
    3. wait for the webElement to be enabled

1. SwitchTo.windows();
2. SwitchTo.frame();

Whenever there is some element in a frame, in order to interact with it we need to shift the focus of the driver to
that frame.

driver.SwitchTo.frame()-->

by id or name
by index
by WebElement

to go back to parent window we use --> driver.switchTo.defaultContent();

explicit waits--->
are they global?
Not global

implicit waits---?
 are global waits --> they are implemented automatically to the whole class
 the appropriate way to implement them is in the beginning of your code after driver.manage().window().maximize();

 implicit wait--> is going to wait until the webElement is found

 explicit wait :

 conditional waits:
  is enabled
  is visible
  is clickable
