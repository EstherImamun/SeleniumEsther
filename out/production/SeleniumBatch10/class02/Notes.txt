DOM:
Document Object Model. it contains all the code of a given website or page.
Web Element:
     Everything we see on a webpage is called a web element.
Text Box:
     is where we can enter or input data
Button:
     is where we click on.

In Selenium, whenever we need to find a particular webElement, we can do that using LOCATORS.
How many locators do we have in Selenium: 8 Locators.
1. ID
2. Name
3. Class
4. linkText ---> they can only be used with a link and it must have a text (a link is usually in the tag <a>)
5. partial link-text  ---> they can only be used with a link and it must have a text or partial text (a link is usually in the tag <a>)
6. Xpath
7. TagName --> just specify the tag that you want to find
8. Css

Why do we need so many locators:
1)  Sometimes there might be a locator with duplicate value
    example;
        <input id="email",name="a"> //first example //in other to ascertain which webElement to locate
        <input id="email",name="b"> //second example //We need to go with the (name) locator instead of the (id)
2)  Sometimes the developers might not provide you with all the locators
    example;
        <input class="login"> //if you have only one locator(class) you can't use another except the (class) locator

There are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator
if an attribute value has a number in it, it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator.!!!

Difference between linkText and partial link text:
    A partial linkText you can use just a part of the text, just make sure that it is unique enough to stand out.

findElement method:
   it is used to find elements from the WebElement like (text box), (button)
   once you find the element you can perform some operation on it like
   driver.findElement(By.id().click or
   driver.findElement(By.id().sendkeys("")
there are other functions too like:
   driver.findElement(By.id().getText()


example of finding a particular element on a webpage using automation

<html>
  <body>
     <input id="name", class="box",x="you">Username</input>
     <input id="pass",class="box">password</input>
      <button id="btn",class="login">login</button>
   </body>
   </html>

//To find an element of TextBox and entering data
driver.findElement(by.id("name")).sendkeys("esther")

//To find an element of TextBox and entering data
driver.findElement(by.id("pass")).sendkeys("1234G")

//To find and element of login and click button
driver.findElement(by.class("login")).click()


What did we learn today?
Locators:
   Locators in selenium help us find the WebElements

   we have 8 Locators
   id, name, className

   LinkText, partial LinkText (they can only be used for <a> and it must also have some text)

   TagName (We just need to pass the tag-name and it is going to find that particular webElement)

   DOM--> document object model:
         This is where we have the whole code for the website

Scenario:
If there are two elements with the same attribute value what will happen?
         Selenium is going to get the first one it encounters
