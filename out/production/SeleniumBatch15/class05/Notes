apraoch to select the check box single

1. inspect the checkbox
2. write down the correct locator in the DOM
3. use findElement to find the check box
4. click on it

if i want to check that checkbox is selected or not?
   checkbox.isSelected();---> True (means selected) False (means not selected)


Preferred Approach when it comes to multiple checkboxes

1. Inspect them in the DOM
2. write the locator in such a way that it is able to select all the required checkboxes
3. use findElements to get all those checkboxes
4. iterate through the list
5. while iterating, look for your desired checkbox (inspect the DOM to see which information provides you the indication
   that this is your desired checkbox)
6. if condition to make the selection

Drop Down:
Two Types:
   1. Single select
   2. Multi select
   ___________________

When it comes to drop down, we have a class in Selenium tha helps us interact with them

--->Select class;--> in order to use this class, your drop down must be made in the DOM using the SELECT tag.

Single Select Drop Down--->
Approach:
1. inspect the drop down
2. Check if it has the Select tag
3. Write down the locator to find the WebElement drop down
4. Declare an object of the Select class (pass the Web element in the parameters)
5. use methods from the Select class to select the desired option
---> selectByVisibleText();
--->selectByValue();
--->selectByIndex();

Multi Select Drop Down--->

Approach:

1. inspect the drop down
2. Check if it has the Select tag
3. Write down the locator to find the WebElement drop down
4. Declare an object of the Select class (pass the Web element in the parameters)
5. use methods select the desired option.



--------------------------------------------Alerts------------------------------------------------------

Alerts are the popup windows that appear and without dealing with them you cannot proceed on with doing anything else.

You can not inspect them.

3 types of Alerts:
1. Java Script alerts ---> using SwitchTo commands.
2. Html based alerts/popups --> we can deal with how we deal with other webElements/we can inspect it
3. Window based --> we can not deal with them using selenium

Java Script alerts:

1. Simple alert
2. Confirmation alert
3. Prompt alert

you deal with all of them in the exact same way
