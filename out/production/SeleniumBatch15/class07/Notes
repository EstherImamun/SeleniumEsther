Webdriver Waits:

1. Implicit
2. Explicit

Implicit Wait--> it is a global wait and is going to wait until the webElement is found.

Explicit Wait--> is conditional wait that is going to wait until a condition is fulfilled.

syntax:
           webDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver,timeOuts);
           wait.until(ExpectedConditions.condition(element));

Can we have both Implicit and Explicit Wait in the same code?

YES

Always have implicit wait in start, it is a good practice

Fluent Wait--> will be taught in interview preparations

Tables can be accessed in three levels

1. table level access--> the whole table will be printed (in a single string)

2. Row level access--> all the rows of the table will be individually printed

3. Column level access--> all the columns of table will be printed individually

What is the major difference in all the access levels in coding?
the major difference is the Xpath.

Examples of using Xpath to access a table:


//table[@id='customers']/tbody/tr[2+1]/td[2] //to access a third row, second column WebElement in a table without a
separate header

//table[@id='example']/tbody/tr[3]/td[2]  //to access a third row, second column WebElement in a table with a
separate header (row and columns)

//table[@id='example']/tbody/tr[1] // to access the first row in a table that has a separate header (row and columns)

//table[@class='table table-hover']/tbody/tr[2]/td[2] // access the second row, second column WebElement in a table
that has a separate header (row and columns)
