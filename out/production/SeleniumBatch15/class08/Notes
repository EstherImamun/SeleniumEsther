Tables:
1. Static  2. Dynamic





Example to locate a webElement that is Dynamic:   //table[@class='SampleTable']/tbody/tr[2+2]/td[1]

Conditions: 1. you can only put metals in the container. 2. in code you can use only container

METAL CONTAINER         RACK--> contains both leather and metals
1. Silver               LEATHER:
2. gold                 Shoes B
3. iron                 Shoes B
4. Titanium             METALS
5. gold                 Silver
                        gold
                        iron
                        titanium
                        gold


Approach:
1. find all the metals and put them in the container
2. loop until the container is empty
   for(int i=0;i<container.size;i++){
   if(container i==gold){
   print("the container with gold is ")i

   }

   }
